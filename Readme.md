1. DDR4 Controller (Top Module)
Description: The top-level module that integrates all sub-modules and interfaces with both the user side (processor/SoC) and the DDR4 PHY (physical layer).
Key Functions:

Coordinates communication between all sub-modules.

Provides user interface for read/write requests.

Connects to DDR4 PHY for low-level signaling.

2. Command Scheduler
Description: Manages the scheduling and prioritization of memory commands while adhering to DDR4 timing constraints.
Key Functions:

Receives user read/write requests.

Implements bank management (open/close rows).

Enforces timing parameters (tRC, tRAS, tRP, etc.).

Handles refresh requests (arbitrates with user commands).

3. Data Path
Description: Handles data movement between the user interface and DDR4 PHY, including buffering and error correction.
Key Functions:

Write data FIFO (buffers data before sending to PHY).

Read data FIFO (buffers data from PHY for user).

ECC (Error Correction Code) generation (for writes) and checking (for reads).

Data alignment and masking.

4. Address/Command Decoder
Description: Translates high-level user commands into DDR4-specific commands and addresses.
Key Functions:

Decodes user addresses into row/column/bank fields.

Generates DDR4 commands (ACT, PRE, RD, WR, etc.).

Manages bank groups and chip selects (CS_n).

5. Refresh Controller
Description: Ensures DDR4 memory is refreshed within required intervals to prevent data loss.
Key Functions:

Tracks refresh intervals (tREFI).

Issues refresh commands (REF).

Manages refresh timing (tRFC).

6. DDR4 PHY Interface
Description: Bridges the controller to the physical DDR4 memory pins, handling electrical signaling.
Key Functions:

Serializes/deserializes data (DQ/DQS).

Manages clock forwarding (CK_t/CK_c).

Handles initialization sequence (DLL calibration, ZQ calibration).

Controls On-Die Termination (ODT).

7. Timing Controller
Description: Configures and enforces DDR4 timing parameters.
Key Functions:

Sets timing constraints based on mode registers (MR0-MR6).

Tracks active timing counters (e.g., tRCD, tWTR).

Ensures compliance with JEDEC DDR4 specifications.

8. Initialization FSM
Description: Manages the power-up and training sequence for DDR4 memory.
Key Functions:

Executes JEDEC-defined initialization steps.

Waits for stable power/clock.

Issues Mode Register Set (MRS) commands.

Handles calibration (DLL, ZQ).

9. ECC Generator
Description: Generates Error Correction Codes for write data.
Key Functions:

Computes Hamming code for 64-bit data (8-bit ECC).

Protects against single-bit errors.

10. ECC Checker
Description: Detects and corrects errors in read data.
Key Functions:

Calculates syndrome to identify errors.

Corrects single-bit errors.

Flags uncorrectable (multi-bit) errors.
